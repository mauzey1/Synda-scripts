# Synda-scripts
scripts to supplement Synda (https://github.com/Prodiguer/synda/)
These scripts were written to satisfy my own needs (replication of ESGF climate data to LLNL), not for general use.
They are far from being clean or polished.
However, in most cases only minor changes will make them useful to others.
